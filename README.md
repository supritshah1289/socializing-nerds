# Ruby on Rails Authentication system
Every application now a days require authentication system. It's good to have a template that is already available to use and get started. Isn't ruby is all about fast development time ?
Why not have authentication system installed on our app on just clicked ?
Well here is repo anyone can fork and use.

# Installation
I have used postgresql for this authentication system
